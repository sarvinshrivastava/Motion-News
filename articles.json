        "content": "The relationship between **NATO and Russia** is currently at its lowest point since the Cold War, primarily due to **Russia&#039;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022**. NATO views Russia as the &quot;most significant and direct threat&quot; to Allied security, and this aggression has fundamentally reshaped European security.\r\n\r\nBefore the invasion, Russia had consistently viewed NATO&#039;s eastward expansion as a threat to its security interests, claiming oral agreements were broken regarding non-expansion. NATO, however, maintains no such promises were formally made and that sovereign nations have the right to choose their alliances.\r\n\r\nIn response to the Ukraine war, NATO has significantly bolstered its **deterrence and defense capabilities** on its eastern flank, deploying thousands of extra troops and conducting large-scale military exercises like &quot;Strong Shield 5&quot; and &quot;Thunder Fortress 2025&quot; in Lithuania. Russia, in turn, has responded by accusing NATO of warmongering and threatening to &quot;neutralize&quot; all NATO efforts, while also increasing its own military presence and capabilities.\r\n\r\nNATO provides **unwavering support to Ukraine**, supplying substantial military, economic, and humanitarian aid, and is committed to helping Ukraine build a defense force capable of deterring future Russian aggression. Despite the extreme tensions, NATO maintains limited channels of communication with Moscow to mitigate risks and prevent escalation, but the overarching sentiment is that there will be no return to the pre-2022 status quo. The conflict in Ukraine is seen by Russia as a broader &quot;shadow war&quot; against NATO and the &quot;collective West,&quot; with Russia&#039;s long-term goal being to dismantle the current international order and restore its sphere of influence.",

        "title": "Operation Sindoor",
        "content": "&amp;quot;Operation Sindoor&amp;quot; refers to a recent, precision military operation carried out by the Indian Armed Forces in response to a terrorist attack in Pahalgam, India, in April 2025, which claimed the lives of 26 innocent tourists. Launched on May 7, 2025, the operation involved targeted strikes on terrorist infrastructure within Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, specifically hitting nine sites without engaging Pakistani military facilities. India emphasized that its actions were focused, measured, and non-escalatory, aimed at holding those responsible for the Pahalgam attack accountable. The operation also highlighted India&amp;#039;s growing self-reliance in defense technology, showcasing the effective use of indigenous systems like Akash air defense missiles, along with advanced drones and loitering munitions, to bypass and jam Chinese-supplied Pakistani air defense systems. Following the military action, India embarked on a widespread diplomatic outreach, sending multi-party delegations to various world capitals to articulate its firm stance against cross-border terrorism and garner international support, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi personally meeting with these delegations to gather feedback. International defense experts have largely hailed Operation Sindoor as a decisive victory, a calibrated use of force that redefined India&amp;#039;s counter-terrorism policy and set a new precedent for its response to threats originating from across the border, effectively signaling a shift in its strategic approach.",
